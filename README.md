# Beat The Pattern

Pattern grows. You follow. Miss once? Game over.  
A memory-based game built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Simple, addictive, and way harder than it looks.


#About

This project challenges your memory and focus.  
Your task? Keep up with an ever-growing sequence of colorful buttons.  
It starts easy, but gets harder with each round.


# How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The system will flash a random button.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
4. If you’re right, you’ll level up and the pattern will grow.
5. One mistake ends the game.
